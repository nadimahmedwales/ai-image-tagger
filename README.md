### Image tagger using AI

This is a very basic image tagging software with plenty of room for improvement. It uses machine learning models hosted by Hugging Face to carry out image classification and image segmentation. It combines the output from the three models, removes duplicates and then outputs the results. The idea is that this can then be used to write to files, or used in other use cases. It can tag multiple images and the output is written to console.

There is a lot of initial downloading required. The amounts for each model is mentioned in the source code, but for the whole lot, expect to download about **800 megabytes**!!!

Due to the ML models used, sometimes the output given can be nonsense. Definitely do not rely on it for anything really important!!!
